# date_analytics

What follows is a simple logic problem that we would like you to solve using whichever language you want to use.

There are a few requirements

1. Set of instructions on how to run the code

2. Code allows user to input start date and end date

3. Code displays output for user to see.

The rest is up to you.

### Counting the Sundays
You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- September, April, June and November have thirty days.
- January, March, May, July, August, October, and December has thirty-one days.
- February alone has twenty-eight, and on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

### Test Cases

* How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
* How many Sundays fell on the first of the month since the day you were born? (You will use your birthday, but we will test with ours)?
* How many Sundays fell on the first of the month this year (2014)?
